# __Grid Based Level Editor__
This level editor was in 4 days for a game that made us win a national contest in Mexico city, the quality of the code is not the best since we were running against time.

30 levels were made using this small editor in a single day, without the editor it would have taken weeks since we had to "Imagine" how the levels would look like and then translate them to a LUA table.

__Feel free to use the code on any project you like.__

## __Current features__

* Adjustable Level size
* Adjustable grid
* Level dump to LUA table
* Easing functions for path drawing
